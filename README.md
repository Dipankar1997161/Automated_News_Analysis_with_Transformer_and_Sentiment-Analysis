### Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of efficiently extracting data from any website. Since data cannot be copied and pasted from many websites, web scraping can be used to retrieve the data and save it in formats such as CSV or text. This data can be captured and later analyzed in various ways. This simplifies your work and automates the process of accessing the actual data and transforming it into a format for analysis. Web scraping is also called web harvesting or web extraction. 

### Text Summarization

Autosummarization is the process of computationally trimming records to create subsets (summaries) that represent the most important or relevant information in the original content. Artificial intelligence algorithms specialized for different types of data are commonly developed and deployed to achieve this.

Text summarization is typically implemented by natural language processing techniques designed to find the most informative sentences within a given document.
